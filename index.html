<p>Gamification is the application of game playing elements
(point scoring, competition, badges, etc.) to other areas
of activity to encourage engagement and participation.
StackOverflow (SO) is a popular Q&amp;A community with
thousands of users solving and answering questions. SO
uses badges and reputation metrics among other things
to practice gamification. The motivation for this project
was to identify and measure the effectiveness of gamification
on SO and to determine how it could be improved
to facilitate engagement. We argue that inclusion of social
media and classification of badges according to technical
proficiencies could improve gamification. To conduct
a qualitative analysis, surveys and interviews were
directed. The first group of users for the survey were selected
by sampling in a medium reputation range from the
SO community and a second group was from students at
the University of Victoria. The questions were revised and
a proper random sampling was conducted. Interviews
were then conducted for users belonging to different reputation
levels. Analysis from the survey results and interviews
showed that inclusion of social media and technical
proficiency is not required; however, they also showed a
need for the reputation system to be more meaningful on
the whole.</p>
