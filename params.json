SO\r\nuses badges and reputation metrics among other things\r\nto practice gamification. The motivation for this project\r\nwas to identify and measure the effectiveness of gamification\r\non SO and to determine how it could be improved\r\nto facilitate engagement. We argue that inclusion of social\r\nmedia and classification of badges according to technical\r\nproficiencies could improve gamification. To conduct\r\na qualitative analysis, surveys and interviews were\r\ndirected. The first group of users for the survey were selected\r\nby sampling in a medium reputation range from the\r\nSO community and a second group was from students at\r\nthe University of Victoria. The questions were revised and\r\na proper random sampling was conducted. Interviews\r\nwere then conducted for users belonging to different reputation\r\nlevels. Analysis from the survey results and interviews\r\nshowed that inclusion of social media and technical\r\nproficiency is not required; however, they also showed a\r\nneed for the reputation system to be more meaningful on\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\n## Publication\r\nThe paper can be downloaded here: [[PDF]](https://github.com/breckwagner/CSCW_Project/raw/master/report/document.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Links\r\nTheis repository [breckwagner/CSCW_Project](https://github.com/breckwagner/CSCW_Project/) forked from [areyeslo/CSCW_Project](https://github.com/areyeslo/CSCW_Project)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
